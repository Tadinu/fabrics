# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [unreleased]

### Ft[capsule]

- Initial working example with capsule collision links.
- Generalized the capsule sphere collision geometry and incorporates multiple capsules into panda example.
- Adds unittesting for capsule_sphere geometry.

### Ft[distances]

- Adds distance functions for most combinations of point/sphere/capsule/plane/line. This paves the path to capsule collision avoidance.

### Ft[docs]

- Adds simple contribution guide.

### Ft[style]

- Splits set_components function into separate functions while keeping the function. Now the individual parts can be called from the outside without breaking old codes using fabrics.
- Removes ambigous arguments robot_type and urdf for forward kinematics from paramaterized planner in favor of passing the fk directly.

### Ft[tests]

- Adds example testing for panda_capsules.

### Ft[update]

- Updates urdfenvs to improve collision links and updating to gymnasium.
- Updates casadi to 3.6.
- Updates planar_robot_esdf according to new forward kinematics.
