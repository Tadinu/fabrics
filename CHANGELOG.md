- Adds environment class to cover environment representations.
- Adds unittesting for environment.
- Corrects for changes in environment number_cuboids having static and dynamic ones.
- Improves handling of not passing collision links or self_collision_pairs to robot_representation.
- Makes collision link the more genal type geomtric primitive.
- Adds distance function to geometric primitives. Finalizes simplified planner accordingly.
