- Removes limits from tiago robot as they were accessed through private attributes.

### Ft[case]

- Adds example for dynamic fabrics with point robot.

### Ft[cleanup]

- Removes unused function get_forward_kinematics_F.
- Removes video recording from panda picking.

### Ft[debug]

- Fixed renaming of panda.py and panda_debug.py
- Trying to make debug function general for all geometries, work in progress (but does run)
- Worked on providing x and xdot per geometry for all types of geometries. Bug is commented in capitals (line 166)
- Added plotting to show geometries in configuration and task space. Still To Do: goal geometries!
- Adds concretize and evaluate for entire leaves.
- Adds debug case to list of agent testing.
- Adds debugging for individual leaves.

### Ft[examples]

- Changes point_robot_urdf.py example to use the generic urdf forward kinematics, thus ignoring the robottype.

### Ft[picking]

- Adds example for picking a box with fabrics.

### Ft[radii]

- Now you can provide a list of radii of the bodies and their corresponding numbers.
- Changes inputs to use dictionaries to be more generic.
- Now you can provide a list of radii of the bodies

### Ft[update]
